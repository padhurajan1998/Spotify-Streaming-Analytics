Spotify Streaming Analytics: Most Streamed Songs of 2023
This project is a comprehensive data analysis of the "Most Streamed Spotify Songs 2023" dataset. The goal of this research endeavor is to unravel the multifaceted dynamics within the on-demand music streaming ecosystem. By exploring underlying patterns, trends, and success factors, the project provides actionable insights for artists, industry professionals, and business stakeholders.


Key Findings & Actionable Insights
My analysis aimed to answer several key questions crucial for artists navigating the modern music industry. The core findings include:


  Understanding the "Recipe for a Hit": I explored the relationships between song traits (like danceability, energy, and valence) and a song's streaming success. This analysis provides a roadmap for       artists to strategically position their content for discovery.
  Platform Performance: The analysis delves into how a song's presence on major platforms (Spotify, Apple Music, Deezer, and Shazam) contributes to its overall popularity.
  Strategic Recommendations: The project offers data-driven recommendations on how artists can optimize their music products and their strategic placement to maximize earnings potential.
